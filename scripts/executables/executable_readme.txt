This folder contains the executables used for the scripts.

Note that for the extract_gps.py script, the exiftool executable should be in the same directory as the script itself.

## Note

If exiftool does not work in Linux, delete the `exiftool` folder under exexutables and run 
```
git clone https://github.com/exiftool/exiftool.git
```
to download the latest version.
